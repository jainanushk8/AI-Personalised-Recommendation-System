# Personalized Recommendation System

## Overview
The Personalized Recommendation System is a web application designed to provide tailored recommendations for videos, articles, and answers to student inquiries. The system leverages various machine learning models to analyze user preferences and deliver personalized content.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories:

- **backend/**: Contains the server-side application code.
  - **app.js**: Entry point for the backend application.
  - **routes/**: Defines the API endpoints.
  - **controllers/**: Contains business logic for handling requests.
  - **models/**: Defines data structures and ORM interactions.
  - **middleware/**: Includes middleware functions for request processing.
  - **config/**: Configuration files for environment variables and database settings.
  - **services/**: Encapsulates business logic and external API interactions.

- **frontend/**: Contains the client-side application code.
  - **src/**: Main source directory for the React application.
    - **components/**: Reusable UI components.
    - **pages/**: Page components representing different views.
    - **redux/**: State management files using Redux.
    - **utils/**: Utility functions for various purposes.
    - **App.jsx**: Main component that sets up routing.

- **ml_models/**: Contains machine learning models for recommendations.
  - **content_based/**: Files for content-based recommendation algorithms.
  - **collaborative/**: Files for collaborative filtering algorithms.
  - **hybrid/**: Files for hybrid recommendation systems.
  - **sentiment_analysis/**: Files for analyzing user feedback.
  - **api/**: API server files for serving machine learning models.

- **data/**: Contains data files for training and testing models.
  - **raw/**: Raw data files.
  - **processed/**: Processed data files.

- **deployment/**: Contains deployment configurations.
  - **Dockerfiles/**: Dockerfiles for containerization.
  - **kubernetes/**: Kubernetes configuration files.
  - **nginx/**: Nginx configuration files.
  - **ci-cd/**: CI/CD pipeline configuration files.

- **docs/**: Documentation and planning materials.
  - **wireframes/**: UI design wireframes.
  - **planning/**: Project planning documents.
