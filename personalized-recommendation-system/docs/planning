# Project Planning Document for Personalized Recommendation System

## Project Overview
The Personalized Recommendation System aims to provide tailored video, article, and answer recommendations to students based on their queries and preferences. The system will utilize various machine learning models to enhance user experience and engagement.

## Objectives
- Develop a backend API to handle user requests and serve recommendations.
- Create a frontend application that allows users to interact with the system seamlessly.
- Implement machine learning models for content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendations.
- Ensure the system is scalable and can handle multiple users simultaneously.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for users.
2. **Recommendation Engine**: Algorithms to suggest relevant content based on user input.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback on recommendations to improve the system.
4. **Admin Dashboard**: For managing content and monitoring user interactions.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux for state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js for API development.
- **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage.
- **Machine Learning**: Python with libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Nginx as a reverse proxy.

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Requirement gathering and initial setup of the project structure.
- **Week 3-4**: Development of backend API and database schema.
- **Week 5-6**: Implementation of frontend components and integration with the backend.
- **Week 7-8**: Development and training of machine learning models.
- **Week 9**: Testing and debugging of the entire system.
- **Week 10**: Deployment and final review.

## Team Roles
- **Project Manager**: Oversee project progress and coordinate between teams.
- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for API development and database management.
- **Frontend Developer**: Focus on building the user interface and user experience.
- **Data Scientist**: Develop and optimize machine learning models.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Handle deployment and infrastructure management.

## Risks and Mitigation
- **Technical Challenges**: Regular code reviews and pair programming to address issues early.
- **Timeline Delays**: Buffer time in the schedule to accommodate unforeseen delays.
- **User Adoption**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback and improve usability.

## Conclusion
This planning document outlines the roadmap for developing the Personalized Recommendation System. By adhering to this plan, the team aims to deliver a robust and user-friendly application that meets the needs of students seeking personalized content recommendations.
